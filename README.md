hello to everyone who sees this. 

this repository is for generation and pose estimation of aruco markers using open cv

you can use the code to generate aruco markers and then show their position in the live video

this code also contains a camera calibration tool and a pickler to calibrate your camera for the code to work

this camera calibration code is not mine but the pickler is

simply save images of a camera calibration board using getimages.py and run the cameracalibration.py
then un pickle the camera matrix and the dist file to get the camera matrix and the distortion and add it to the arucodetector code

thank you!
